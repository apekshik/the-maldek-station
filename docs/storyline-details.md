## Opening Sequence (Night 1)

### The Arrival

The player starts outside their parked car at the base of the forest path. No UI, no prompts. They walk.

**Forest path → Stairs → Platform → Control room.**

- **Forest:** Dense, dark, claustrophobic. Near-silence — wind through pines, gravel underfoot, maybe distant cable hum as they get closer. No voice, no radio, no music. The silence establishes isolation before anything else. The player feels "you are alone, this place is remote, no one is nearby."
- **Stairs up:** The view opens as the player climbs. A vertical transition from enclosed forest to exposed alpine. When they crest the stairs they see the full cable line stretching into the dark mountain, with the single amber dot of Maldek station in the distance. This is the title card moment — the image that defines the game.
- **Platform:** The gondola is sitting docked. Quiet, inert, just a metal box. The player's first encounter with the thing that will terrorize them for five nights is completely mundane. This initial impression of "just equipment" is what makes it unsettling later. Two overhead industrial lamps light the platform; the edges fall into dark forest.
- **Control room:** The player steps inside. Lights flicker on. The space heater is already running. The panel is in standby mode. The room is warm and contained — a cockpit. The previous operator's note is taped to the desk. The logbook is open. The player is free to look around.

### The Dispatch Briefing

Once the player is in the control room, the radio crackles to life. Dispatch calls in. This is the first voice the player hears in the game.

The briefing covers three things:

1. **The job.** You run the overnight stress test cycles. Here's the lever, here's the panel, you log each cycle in the book. Routine stuff.
2. **The context.** The previous operator left. You're the replacement. Nothing to worry about — people rotate through these postings. It's a boring job, that's all.
3. **The hook.** Dispatch makes a joke. Something like: *"Well, if anyone rides it back down, tell 'em they owe us a ticket."* Then a beat of silence that's a little too long. Or they laugh at their own joke but the laugh is slightly forced, like they're pushing past something. Then they move on, business as usual.

### Why the Hook Works

- **On first hearing:** Just an awkward coworker moment. Dispatch trying to be friendly with the new guy, joke doesn't land. Player barely registers it.
- **By Night 3:** The tension gauge shows passenger weight. The gondola smells like a crowd. The joke replays in the player's head and it's not a joke anymore. The player connects the dots themselves — no signposting needed.
- **Dispatch characterization:** This is someone who's been at this a while. Maybe they've heard things from previous operators. Maybe they know more than they let on. Or maybe it's genuinely just a bad joke and the player is projecting because they're alone on a mountain at midnight. The ambiguity is the point — it aligns with Night 2's "Doubt" philosophy.
- **Voice acting note:** The delivery on the joke line is critical. Too flat and the player misses it entirely. Too loaded and it feels like a cutscene telegraph. It needs to sound like someone who almost said something real and then pulled it back into a joke. A micro-hesitation.

### After the Briefing

Dispatch signs off. The player is alone in the control room. They can:
- Read the previous operator's note on the desk
- Explore the control room props (logbook, emergency procedures card, cable line photograph, coat hook with flashlight)
- Examine the panel and learn the gauges
- Walk back out to the platform
- Visit the maintenance room, the overlook

Night 1's first cycle begins when the player sends the gondola up for the first time.

## Night 1 — Normal (Pacing Notes)

The entire night must feel like a real job. No horror, no hints beyond the opening hook. The atmosphere carries the weight: the isolation, the sound design, the act of learning the loop. The player must fully internalize what "normal" feels, looks, and sounds like. Every future violation depends on this baseline.

**Key tension sources (non-horror):**
- The wait. 3-4 minutes of real time between send and return. Just watching the cable, the mountain, the dark.
- The exposure. Walking out to the platform at night to receive the car. The pool of light with forest darkness on every edge.
- The gondola interior. Stepping into a confined box that just traveled somewhere you can't see. Even when it's completely clean and empty, the act is inherently tense.
- The sounds. Generator hum, wind, cable movement, mechanical clunks. Learning which sounds are normal so the player can later detect when they're not.

## Between-Night Transitions

*To be detailed — how do nights begin and end? Fade to black? Walking to the car and back? The between-night beats ("the thermos has moved," "the door is already unlocked") need a delivery mechanism.*

## Night-by-Night Anomaly Progression

*To be detailed — per-cycle event scripting for Nights 2-5. Density and ordering of anomalies within each night's 3-4 cycles.*

## Open Questions

- Does the player find the previous operator's note during initial exploration, or does something draw their attention to it?
- After the dispatch briefing, does dispatch tell the player to send the first cycle immediately, or is the player free to explore first?
- What exactly does the previous operator's note say? It needs to be ambiguous: possibly helpful, possibly a warning, possibly unhinged. The tone should read differently on Night 1 vs. re-reading it on Night 4.
